<p>Bueno, pues voy a ampliar el ejemplo del <a href="https://muestrear-no-es-pecado.netlify.app/2021/05/14/cosas-viejunas-o-big-data-para-pobres/">Ãºltimo dÃ­a</a>, como es viernes, estoy cansado y me irÃ© a tomar una birra pronto, intentarÃ© ser breve.</p>
<p>Levantamos una sesiÃ³n de spark y leemos los mismos datos del otro dÃ­a. Ya de paso voy a probar el operador pipe nativo en R base <code>|&gt;</code>. Si tienes la nueva versiÃ³n de R instalada y la versiÃ³n de Rstudio preview, en global options puedes poner para que al hacer Ctrl + Shift +M aparezca el nuevo operador o el antiguo.</p>

<p>Y ahora procedemos a agregar los datos y traerlos a local. Y seguro que alguno se pregunta Â¿por quÃ© no haces el modelo en spark?. PodrÃ­a hacerlo, ya he contado en este blog como hacer modelos usando sparkling water por ejemplo, pero podrÃ­a querer ajustar un tipo de modelo que no estÃ© en distribuido, no sÃ©, un modelo mixto con <code>glmer</code> o con <code>stan</code> . De hecho es eso lo que voy a hacer, un <code>glmer</code>.</p>
